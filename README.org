* AnyCode

Tired of thinking what code to write to train you brain and finger?
Get confused with the fork, clone, pull request flow of GitHub?
Want to make your contribution graph all green with comfortable and safe pull requests?

** Then you can:
** Fork this repo, Write any code you like, then Pull Request, you will know how GitHub works.

I will receive any pull request, it's just for fun!
Any code pieces, fragments, life records, crazy ideas will be OK, just write and commit, that's the point!

I will give you some help if you need.

Enjoy!
